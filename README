Description
--
Filewatcher is a Firefox extension which automagically reloads local files in the browser when the file is modified.
This by continiously checking for variations in the files timestamp and size.

The plugin is only active in tabs browsing local files.
Enabling/disabling the extensions is done through a button in the toolbar

The plugin requires a newer version of Firefox (not determined yet)

How to install
--
When in Firefox, press Ctrl+O, select filewatcher-<version>.xpi, follow instructions
